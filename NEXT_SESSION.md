All polishing tasks for public release have been completed successfully!

## Completed Work

âœ… **Card Visualization** - Cards now display ASCII art from `claude_tarot_deck_design/`
âœ… **Enhanced CLI Interface** - Comprehensive help with all spreads visualized
âœ… **Error Handling** - Clear, helpful error messages for all edge cases
âœ… **JSDoc Documentation** - All functions fully documented
âœ… **Fixed Demo Paths** - Updated all hardcoded paths to relative paths
âœ… **Comprehensive Testing** - All 5 spreads tested successfully

## Previous Goals (All Achieved)

### 1. Code Quality âœ…

- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with try-catch
- âœ… Clean code organization
- âœ… JSDoc comments for all functions

### 2. CLI Interface âœ…
- âœ… Enhanced argument parsing with validation
- âœ… Beautiful help text showing all spreads with visualizations
- âœ… Clear, helpful error messages
- âœ… **Card art always displayed in every reading**

### 3. Module Exports âœ…
- âœ… Works as CLI tool (#!/usr/bin/env node)
- âœ… Works as require/import module
- âœ… All functions properly exported

### 4. Documentation âœ…

- âœ… Fixed all hardcoded paths in demo.md
- âœ… README matches actual API
- âœ… Usage examples updated with CLI and module options

### 5. Testing âœ…
- âœ… All 5 spread types tested successfully

- âœ… Module import tested
- âœ… Error handling verified

### 6. File Path Issues âœ…
- âœ… All paths in demo.md updated to relative paths
- âœ… Added both CLI and module usage examples

## Key Improvements Made

### Card Visualization System
- Created `loadCardArt()` function to read ASCII art from card design files
- Created `rotateCard()` function for future reversed card support
- Integrated card art into `displayReading()` for both single and multi-card spreads

### Enhanced CLI Experience
- Comprehensive help display with all spread visualizations
- Input validation for spread types and random strategies
- Helpful error messages guiding users to correct usage

### Code Quality
- Added JSDoc documentation to all functions
- Modern JavaScript patterns (const, let, arrow functions where appropriate)
- Proper error handling with try-catch and defaults

## Ready for Public Release

The repository is now ready to be made public! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Make repository public
- Consider adding more spread types
- Potential future enhancements (interactive mode, card reversal meanings, etc.)
