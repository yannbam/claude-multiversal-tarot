## Areas to Review

### 1. Code Quality
- Modern JavaScript patterns and best practices
- Error handling and edge cases
- Code organization and structure
- Consistent style

### 2. CLI Interface
- Argument parsing (currently basic)
- Help text and usage examples
- Better error messages
- Consider interactive mode

### 3. Module Exports
- Works as CLI tool (#!/usr/bin/env node)
- Works as require/import module
- Clean API documentation

### 4. Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all functions
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure README matches actual API
- Usage examples tested and accurate

### 5. Testing
- Test all 5 spread types thoroughly
- Verify visual representations work
- Check reading generation quality
- Edge case handling

### 6. File Path Issues
- Currently has hardcoded paths to `/home/jan/.nb/claude/...` in demo.md
- Need to update these to use relative paths or the new location
